# Peek DMEE Libraries (PeekDMEELibraries)
This is utility program for viewing and handling the content of Draftsman-EE (DMEE) library (.LBR) files.
The program includes the ability to extract a module (part) from the library and write the content to a separate file. The source code demonstrates how the
"dictionary" within the LBR file can be searched for a given module and how corresponding data for the module can be obtained.

# Background
I created this to help understand the structure of library files, examine modules, 
and develop the basis for library access routines for the DMEE Viewer program.

# Development Environment and Executables
The project is presently being developed and tested as a Windows "Forms" application using C# and .NET Framework 4.6.1
and built using Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition, 2017 on Windows 10 64-bit.
